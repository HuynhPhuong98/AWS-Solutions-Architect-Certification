Study Notes for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Exam

I am sharing here my study notes that I wrote while preparing for the AWS SA-Pro exam.

Thank God, I was able to pass the exam in the first attempt with a score of 916/1000. The passing score is 750.

The main source of these notes is the AWS documentation (developer and user guides): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/.

The only challenges I faced when preparing for the exam preparation were on these two aspects:
- The large number of services to study means that there is a huge quantity of information to remember.
- You don't really know the depth of knowledge you need on each product for the exam. So you just keep digging :-)
